NOTE:
	These sources are highly modified to co-relate with Scpel
	by Phrunsys Emmasson. Thus hereby acertain that these, and most
	of Scpel toolchain is built and inspired around GNU Compiler
	Collections. So the GNU Toolchain covers most of the documentation,
	portability, and architectures.
	
		1)	Please: I highly recomend that you (Good Fellow) should merily
			navigate and review the folder $(src)/LICENCES as it 
			contains most of that good stuff that now all devine tech-humanity
			stands for.
		2)	This specific implementation strongly supports only Scpel
			which inturn only covers (GNU C, GNU C++) Scpel, which then
			adds specific Artificial intelligence related concepts in GCC.
		3)	This file (SPL-README) is here because I've always found it
			more humble having all implementation unrelated text out of 
			sourcefiles thus keeping them more precise.
		4)	For Scpel related documentation and implementation details
			please visit https://www.scpel.org.
		5)	This is one of my humble works (the least). Scpel Aims at targeting
			Artificial intelligence at the ** Lowest**  level as possible
			and so high at the application level using C++'s STL
