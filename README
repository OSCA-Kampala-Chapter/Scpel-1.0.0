NOTE:
	Please review $(src-dir/LICENCES)
   
NOTE:
	These sources are highly modified to co-relate with Scpel
	by Phrunsys Emmasson. Thus hereby acertain that these, and most
	of Scpel toolchain is built and inspired around GNU Compiler
	Collections. So the GNU Toolchain covers most of the documentation,
	portability, and architectures.
		1)	Please Note: I highly recommend that you should merrily
			navigate to and review the folder $(src)/LICENCES because it 
			contains most of the good stuff that all divine tech-humanity
			stands for.
		2)	This specific implementation strongly supports only Scpel
			which in turn only covers (GNU C, GNU C++) Scpel, which then
			adds specific artificial intelligence related concepts in GCC.
		3)	This file (SPL-README) is here because I've always found it
			humble to have all the implementation unrelated text separated out of 
			the source files thus keeping them precise.
		4)	For Scpel related documentation and implementation guidelines;
			please visit https://www.scpel.org.
		5)	This is one of my humble works. Scpel aims at targeting
			artificial intelligence on the ** lowest**  level possible
			and so high at the application level using C++'s STL
